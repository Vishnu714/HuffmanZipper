# HuffmanZipper

HuffmanZipper is a Java project that implements file compression and decompression using the Huffman coding algorithm. Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters, thereby achieving compression.
